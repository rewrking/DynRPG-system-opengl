# system_opengl
##### v1.1
A DynRPG plugin to enable OpenGL rendering in older RPG Maker 2003 games

![screenshot](https://rpgmaker.net/media/content/users/40/locker/rmopengl.png)

Features:  
   * Fast Fullscreen/Windowed mode switching
   * **Large window sizes** (up to the desktop resolution's height... 4k etc.)
   * Fullscreen mode set to the desktop resolution with pixel scaling options (or a "classic" 640x480 fullscreen mode)
   * Interpolation
   * **Shader support** (The possibilities are endless)
   * **Video Options** menu similar to the Retail/Steam version of RM2003 (but drawn in OpenGL)
   * **TRANSLATIONS** for the Video Options menu mentioned above
   * An actual screenshot key that will capture a perfect 320x240 screenshot (without shaders) to a png file.
   * **[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.0/)** (See advanced section at the bottom of the page)

Note: If your game uses the "Play Movie" command, this plugin doesn't handle it well from a fullscreen context (since OpenGL's fullscreen mode is exclusive), so it has to switch back to a window. This is obviously not great, but it's the best I could do. If playing in a window, the video should play fine. Personally, I would suggest not using "Play Movie" at all since it's garbage to begin with (calling it twice in a row for example will show a black screen the second time). If that doesn't apply to you, then onward!

## Usage

**F4 key** - now toggles between numerous window sizes supported by your monitor (1x, 2x, 3x, 4x etc)

**F5 key** - Launches into the "Video Options" menu, navigated with arrow keys. F5 again, or Escape will exit the menu.

## Changelog

1.1 - Updated SFML to v2.5.0 (update all *.dll files from this repo into your game)  
1.0 - Initial release


## Plugin Conflicts

**[game_settings](https://github.com/rewrking/game_settings)** - This plugin must be removed before installing this one. Take out any files related to "another fullscreen mode" as they won't be needed.


## Installation

To install the plugin, make sure that you have patched your project with Cherry's DynRPG patch which can be found here:  
http://share.cherrytree.at/showfile-30511/dynrpg_0_32_02_25_2017.rar (v0.32 Unofficial)

1. Remove the **game_settings.dll** plugin (if applicable), including any settings for it

2. Copy the contents of the "opengl" folder into a DynRPG project folder. You should now have:
   * A "Shaders" folder
   * A "Settings.ini" file
   * SFML .dll files: 
      * libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll
      * libstdc++-6.dll
      * openal32.dll
      * sfml-audio-2.dll
      * sfml-graphics-2.dll
      * sfml-network-2.dll
      * sfml-system-2.dll
      * sfml-window-2.dll
   * An "Add_to_DynRPG.ini.txt" file
   * DynPlugins\miranda_nbp.ttf - The font used for the Video Options menu
   * DynPlugin\system_opengl.dll
   * DynPlugin\system_opengl_translation.ini (Contact me about adding translations)

3. Copy the contents of "Add_to_DynRPG.ini.txt" into your DynRPG.ini file. Review it below:

		[system_opengl]
		; Game ini filename 
		; Default: Settings.ini
		GameIniFilename=Settings.ini
		; Shader Syntax:
		;   Shader#=filenameNoExt
		;     (filenames should be formatted as Shader_Name (title case with underscores) for menus
		;   Shader#frag=true  --defined as a .frag (pixel shader)
		;   Shader#frag=true  --defined as a .vert (vertex shader)
		;     (both can use combined if using both .frag & .vert)
		;   Shader2useTexDims=true  --shader requires the use of the texture dimensions of the screen (320x240). 
		;     This value is hard-coded and looks for a uniform vec2 called "texture_dimensions"
		;     If you need input/output size, just use texture_dimensions.xy for input and texture_dimensions.xy*# for output.
		;   Shader2numFloatParams=#
		;   Shader#paramFloat#name=paramvarname
		;     (The parameter's value is set via comment command (by its name)
		; Default: 2
		NumShaders=5
		DisableVideoMenu=false
		;
		Shader1=Scale2x
		Shader1frag=true
		Shader1useTexDims=true
		;
		Shader2=CRT
		Shader2frag=true
		Shader2useTexDims=true
		Shader2numFloatParams=2
		Shader2paramFloat1name=distortion
		Shader2paramFloat2name=zoom
		;
		Shader3=Game_Boy
		Shader3frag=true
		;
		Shader4=Game_Boy_Pocket
		Shader4frag=true
		;
		Shader5=Virtual_Boy
		Shader5frag=true
		;
		Shader6=Old_PC
		Shader6frag=true
		;
		Shader7=Noir
		Shader7frag=true
		;
		Shader8=Sepia
		Shader8frag=true
		;
		Shader9=Invert
		Shader9frag=true
		;
		Shader10=CB_Protanopia
		Shader10frag=true
		;
		Shader11=CB_Deuteranopia
		Shader11frag=true
		;
		Shader12=CB_Tritanopia
		Shader12frag=true
		;
		Shader13=CB_Achromatopsia
		Shader13frag=true
		;
		Shader14=CB_Protanomaly
		Shader14frag=true
		;
		Shader15=CB_Deuteranomaly
		Shader15frag=true
		;
		Shader16=CB_Tritanomaly
		Shader16frag=true
		;
		Shader17=CB_Achromatomaly
		Shader17frag=true

	Review the Shader syntax. It supports simple float parameters that be passed to the shader via comment command, as well as a predefined "texture_dimensions" parameter. You'll need to recompile the plugin from the source code if you want to do more with the shader capabilities.
	
	Set NumShaders=17 to see all of the included ones, otherwise it defaults to the first 5. Feel free to re-arrange & re-number the shaders once you understand the syntax above.

	By default, this plugin contains a new "Video Options" menu that appears after hitting F5 or being called via comment command. Set DisableVideoMenu to true to to disable it (if you plan on building one yourself)

4. Review the contents of the new Settings.ini:


		[Settings]
		;=======General=======
		ScreenshotPath=C:\
		Translation=en
		;
		;=======Video=======
		; 0=No, 1=Yes
		Fullscreen=0
		StartFullscreen=0
		; DirectDraw
		;   Set UseDirectDraw to "1" to disable OpenGL (for older PC's)
		UseDirectDraw=0
		; OpenGL
		;   Window Scale is constrained by the desktop resolution, so if you have a 1080p monitor, the max will be "4"
		;   1 = 320x240, 2 = 640x480, 3 = 960x720, 4 = 1280x960, 5 = 1600x1200, 8 = 2560x1920, 9 = 2880x2160
		WindowScale=4
		EnableVSync=1
		UseDesktopResolution=1
		;   Ensures pixels are not stretched out more than a 1:1 ratio in fullscreen mode
		;   0=Scale to display's edges (retaining aspect ratio), 1=Use it
		AllowUnevenPixelSizes=0
		IgnoreAspectRatio=0
		UseInterpolation=0
		UseShaders=0
		ShaderId=0
		;
		;=======Gamepad=======
		; If using the Xbox 360 Controller, turns the rumble On or Off
		RumbleOn=0

	Set "ScreenshotPath" to the path of your choice. When you use the "Print Screen" key, a perfect screenshot (without shaders) will get placed in this folder.

	Set "Translation" to the translation header in system_opengl_translation.ini - See the section below
	
	Set "StartFullscreen" to 1 if you want to always start in fullscreen mode regardless of the last state the game was in, otherwise if it's "0", the plugin will look to the "Fullscreen" parameter. "Fullscreen" is enforced by the plugin, wereas "StartFullscreen" is not. Set both to 0 to start in windowed mode.

	If for some reason you or someone playing your game can't use OpenGL, set "UseDirectDraw" to 0 to disable it entirely.

	The "Gamepad" section is actually used by the [xbx_controller](https://github.com/rewrking/xbx_controller), plugin, but I'm including it here for completion's sake. If you know of any other plugins that use the Settings.ini, you'll want to account for that before copying the above one in.


## Notes about Translations


Supported "Video Options" menu translations:
   * **en** (English)
   * **sp** (Spanish)
   * **fr** (French)
   * **de** (German)
   * **it** (Italian)

As of 1.0, the non-english translations are literally from google translate, so if they're not accurate, please let me know! Also, if you would like to add additional translations, let me know as well. They are very easy.

**system_opengl_translation.ini** format:

	[en]
	VideoOptions=Video Options
	RenderMode=Render Mode
	DirectDraw=DirectDraw
	OpenGL=OpenGL
	DisplayMode=Display Mode
	Fullscreen=Fullscreen
	Windowed=Windowed
	WindowResolution=Window Resolution
	UseDesktopResolution=Use Desktop Resolution
	Yes=Yes
	No=No
	AllowUnevenPixels=Allow Uneven Pixels
	IgnoreAspectRatio=Ignore Aspect Ratio
	Interpolation=Interpolation
	Shader=Shader
	None=None

The key (first value) will always be in english TitleCase, whereas the actual translation will be the value to the right. The header (en) in this case define what language this is. It can be anything, but I decided to go with 2 character abbreviations


## DynRPG Comment Commands

### **==Misc==**

**@load_video_options**
   * Call the video options menu from anywhere

## Advanced (Recompiling from source & adding stuff)

Since this effectively turns your project into one that supports OpenGL, you can expand on your project in some new (but limited) ways.

First limitation is to keep in mind this does NOT allow you to place OpenGL objects inside of your game. It's simply a new renderer. However, if you want to dip your toes into SFML and maybe make some menus or something that can be layered on top of the existing engine, read further.

Recompiling this plugin has a big requirement. Not just ANY version of SFML, but only the included version that I've compiled for TDM GCC 4.8.1 (The compiler that DynRPG requires)

1. Extract the **src\\SFML-2.5.0-TDM-GCC-32.7z** file with 7-zip to **C:\\SFML-2.5.0-TDM-GCC-32\\**

2. Copy the rest of the included **src** folder somewhere and open the **system_opengl.cbp** project file.

3. The linker and search directories for SFML should be setup already. Make sure DynRPG is in your compiler's include folder (C:\\TDM-GCC-32\\ in my case).

4. Build it. It should compile.
